# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Science that focuses on the use of Data Analysis that automates the creation of analytical models and algorithms that iteratively learn from data by improving their accuracy.

## Machine Learning Methods

Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.

- Supervised Machine Learning
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Machine Learning

**Supervised Machine Learning**

>Supervised Learning, also known as Supervised Machine Learning, is defined by the use of labeled datasets to train algorithms and predict labels based on known features with accurate results. One process of cross-validation is to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting.

**Unsupervised Machine Learning**

>Unsupervised Learning, also known as Unsupervised Machine Learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify unlabeled data sets and attempts to group similar data points based on features.

**Reinforcement Machine Learning**

>Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isnâ€™t trained using sample data. This model algorithm learns to act as experience.  


## Software

Machine Learning uses various software to create projects:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - IDE / Text Editor
- [Python Programming](https://python.org/) - Programming Language
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Pandas is a Data Analysis and Manipulation Tool built on Python Programming
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a library for creating interactive Visualizations in Python
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Scikit-Learn is a Machine Learning library for the Python Programming
